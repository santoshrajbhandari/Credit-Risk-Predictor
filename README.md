# Credit-Risk-Predictor
 A machine learning model to **predict credit default risk** using a dataset of loan applicants. The goal is to help financial institutions **balance between accepting more applicants** and **minimizing loan defaults**, which can lead to major financial loss.

---

## Objective

Develop a classification model that:
- Identifies **high-risk loan applicants** (likely to default),
- Maintains **high recall** for defaulters,
- Minimizes **false positives**, i.e., avoids wrongly labeling good customers as defaulters,
- Allows **threshold tuning** to align with business strategy.

## ⚖️ The Business Trade-Off

In real-world lending decisions, there’s a **critical trade-off**:

- **Approving more loans** increases revenue and customer acquisition.
- But **approving too many risky applicants** leads to **higher default rates**.

### Two types of prediction errors:
| Error Type | Description | Cost |
|------------|-------------|------|
| False Positive (FP) | Predicting someone **will default** when they won’t | ❌ Lost revenue, unhappy rejected customers |
| False Negative (FN) | Predicting someone **won’t default** when they do | ❌ Direct financial loss due to unpaid loans |

> The goal is to find the **right threshold** that balances business growth with financial safety.

## Dataset Summary

- Total records: 4000
- Features: Demographics, financial metrics, housing type, etc.
- Target: `default` (0 = no, 1 = yes)
- Strong class imbalance (~93% non-defaulters, 7% defaulters)

---

## Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Class weights** and **SMOTE** used to handle class imbalance
- Custom threshold tuning (e.g., 0.3–0.5) for maximizing recall
